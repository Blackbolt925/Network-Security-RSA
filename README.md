# Network-Security-RSA
Implemented the RSA algorithm as part of a course project. 
## About:
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptographic algorithm that forms the backbone of 
many secure communication protocols. It relies on the mathemtical hardness of factoring the 
product of two large prime numbers, a problem for which no efficient solution is known. RSA uses a 
key pair: a public key for encrytion and a private key for decrytion. The keys are generated using 
modular arithmtic and Euler’s totient function. RSA is widely used in secure data transmission, 
digital signatures, and key exchange mechanisms. Its asymmetric nature allows it to provide both 
confidetiality and authentication, making it a critical component of modern network security 
infrastructures. 
## Other:
Also Implemented Data Encryption Standard(DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard(AES).
