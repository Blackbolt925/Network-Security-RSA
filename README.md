# Network-Security-RSA
Implemented the RSA algorithm as part of a course project. 
## About:
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptographic algorithm that forms the backbone of 
many secure communica on protocols. It relies on the mathema cal hardness of factoring the 
product of two large prime numbers, a problem for which no efficient solu on is known. RSA uses a 
key pair: a public key for encryp on and a private key for decryp on. The keys are generated using 
modular arithme c and Euler’s to ent func on. RSA is widely used in secure data transmission, 
digital signatures, and key exchange mechanisms. Its asymmetric nature allows it to provide both 
confiden ality and authen ca on, making it a cri cal component of modern network security 
infrastructures.
